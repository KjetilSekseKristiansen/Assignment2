# Mutex and Channel basics

### What is an atomic operation?
> Atomic operations in concurrent programming are program operations that run completely independently of any other processes. 

### What is a semaphore?
> An abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system. 

### What is a mutex?
> When I am having a big heated discussion at work, I use a rubber chicken which I keep in my desk for just such occasions. The person holding the chicken is the only person who is allowed to talk. If you don't hold the chicken you cannot speak. You can only indicate that you want the chicken and wait until you get it before you speak. Once you have finished speaking, you can hand the chicken back to the moderator who will hand it to the next person to speak. This ensures that people do not speak over each other, and also have their own space to talk.

Replace Chicken with Mutex and person with thread and you basically have the concept of a mutex
